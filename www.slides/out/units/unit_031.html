        <div class="notes">So the problem is that we seem to have conflicting answers to the question: one set of evidence says early, the other late.</div>
        <div class="notes">Resolving the apparent conflict requires responding to an instance of Davidson's challenge and finding ways of describing phenomena in between mindless ignorance of unseen objects and adult-like knowledge of objects.  </div>
        <div class="notes">In what follows we will repeatedly encounter challenges of this form.</div>

        <div class="notes">At this point you might object.  The question is about knowledge.  But does either searching or distinguishing really provide evidence of knowing?</div>

          <p class="em-above">talk about objects: much later</p>
          <div class="notes">You might insist that only abilities to talk about objects manifest evidence of knowledge.</div>
          <div class="notes">It is a good question whether searching or distinguishing manifests knowledge.</div>

        <div class="notes">First note that we can duck this hard issue by changing from talk about knowledge to talk about representation.</div>
        <div class="notes">Searching and distinguishing certainly seem to show that infants are representing objects they can't see.</div>
        <div class="notes">Second note that whether or not the things manifested in searching and distinguishing are knowledge proper, they are surely things that matter for explaining how knowledge is eventually acquired.</div>

  <div class="notes">To sum up so far, the question for this course is, How do humans come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?</div>
  <div class="notes">I've been suggesting we can't answer it simply by appealing to nativism, empiricism or other grand myths.</div>
  <div class="notes">Instead we need to focus on the particular mechanisms that are involved in different cases.</div>
  <div class="notes">But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly pscyhological---and therefore scientific---issue?</div>
  <div class="notes">The answer is no because thinking about how humans come to know things requires us to meet Davidson's challenge, to understand things that are neither mindless nor thought or knowledge but somewhere in between.</div>
