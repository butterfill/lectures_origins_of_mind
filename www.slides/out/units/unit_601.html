  <div class="notes">When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very reliable pattern.</div>
  <div class="notes">At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand closing only once you contact the object.</div>
  <div class="notes">Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of the object.</div>

          <div class="notes">Superficially things look better here.  There is both evidence that rich forms of social interaction facilitate development \citep{Hughes:2006fu}</div>
          <div class="notes">and also evidence that language matters in various ways \citep{Astington2005ot}.</div>
          <div class="notes">But these probably don't connect in the simple way I envisage.</div>
          <div class="notes">Social interaction might matter because it provides experiences of perspective differences, or because it motivates children to think about others' minds.</div>
          <div class="notes">And language might matter because having sentences around enables them to keep track of beliefs, or because using relative clauses might clue them in to a relation between beliefs and what utterances of sentences express.</div>
          <div class="notes">So here the picture isn't right, but it might not be a million miles off either ...</div>
          <div class="notes">It's wrong to think that labelling beliefs matters; but it may be that being able to talk about beliefs (implicitly or otherwise) does matter for coming to have knowledge of them.</div>
