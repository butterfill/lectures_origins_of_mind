          <div class="notes">In answer to Q2, I suggested that we start with the simple view.  </div>
          <div class="notes handout">
            The \emph{simple view} is the view that 
            the principles of object perception are things that we know, and we generate expectations from these principles by a process of inference.
          </div>
          <div class="notes">The attraction of the simple view is that it promises to explain infants' sensitivity to objects' boundaries, their persistence and their causal interactions as manifested in a variety of looking behaviours.</div>

        <div class="notes">The problem for the simple view is that it makes exactly the wrong prediction about infants' reaching behaviours.</div>
        <div class="notes">This problem arises twice, once for object permanence and again for causal interactions.</div>
        <div class="notes">
          In the case of object permanence, the problem is 
          that four and five month old infants appear to be surprised when a solid object is placed behind a drawbridge 
          and then the drawbridge rotates back 180 degrees as if the object wasn't there.  
          But if you put a desirable object behind a screen, these infants won't ever search behind the screen for the object. 
          So if we measure their looking behaviours, they seem to know that an object is behind the screen; 
          but if we measure their searching behaviours they seem not to know this.

  <div class="notes">The problem for the simple view is that it correctly predicts looking behaviours but not searching behaviours.</div>
  <div class="notes">This problem arises a second time in the case of infants' abilities to track causal interactions.</div>
  <div class="notes">Suppose you roll a ball down this ramp and remove it from behind one of the doors.</div>
  <div class="notes">You can predict where the ball will stop because you can see this barrier sticking up here.</div>
  <div class="notes">2 and 2.5 year olds will look longer if you remove it from any door other than the right one.</div>
  <div class="notes">These children and infants can also predict the location of the object (not just identify a violation, but look forward to where the object is) \citep{mash:2006_what}.</div>
  <div class="notes">
    But if you ask them to remove the ball (and offer them a reward for doing so), 
    the two year olds will typically choose a favourite door to open every time regardless of where the barrier is  
    (incidentally this is not random but seems to be based on momentum \citep{perry:2008_representational}), 
    and the 2.5 year olds will choose a door adjacent to the barrier but do not prefer the door on the correct side of the barrier.

          <div class="notes">Why is this important?</div>
          <div class="notes">The discovery of infant abilities presents us with a dilemma.</div>
          <div class="notes">If we follow researchers like Michael Tomasello in dismissing infants' abilities to focus on social interactions, culture and language, we miss something important about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that coming to know things about physical objects (and colours, and mind and more besides) involves multiple layers of representation.</div>
          <div class="notes">But if we follow researchers like Spelke and Baillargeon is discussing infants' abilities as if they were based on knowledge, belief and inference, we will also miss something important about the origins of knowledge.  We will miss the fact that infants' abilities, although essential for later developments, are only indirectly related to the knowledge of physical objects that adult humans enjoy.</div>
          <div class="notes">The challenge is to avoid this dilemma, to provide a theoretical framework that will allow us to understand how infants' abilities support the emergence of knowledge without themselves amounting to knowledge.</div>

  <div class="notes">Not all researchers agree about the properties of modules.  That they are informationally encapsulated is denied by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson (2002: 9), Simon Baron-Cohen (1995) and some evolutionary psychologists (Buller and Hardcastle 2000: 309), whereas Scholl and Leslie claim that information encapsulation is the essence of modularity and that any other properties modules have follow from this one (1999b: 133; this also seems to fit what David Marr had in mind, e.g. Marr 1982: 100-1).  According to Max Coltheart, the key to modularity is not information encapsulation but domain specificity; he suggests Fodor should have defined a module simply as 'a cognitive system whose application is domain specific' (1999: 118).  Peter Carruthers, on the other hand, denies that domain specificity is a feature of all modules (2006: 6).  Fodor stipulated that modules are 'innately specified' (1983: 37, 119), and some theorists assume that modules, if they exist, must be innate in the sense of being implemented by neural regions whose structures are genetically specified (e.g. de Haan, Humphreys and Johnson 2002: 207; Tanaka and Gauthier 1997: 85); others hold that innateness is 'orthogonal' to modularity (Karmiloff-Smith 2006: 568).  There is also debate over how to understand individual properties modules might have (e.g. Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994 on the meanings of domain specificity; Samuels 2004 on innateness).</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_028.jpg" class="bkg"/>

  <div class="notes">In short, then, theorists invoke many different notions of modularity, each barely different from others.  You might think this is just a terminological issue.  I want to argue that there is a substantial problem: we currently lack any theoretically viable account of what modules are.  The problem is not that 'module' is used to mean different things-after all, there might be different kinds of module.  The problem is that none of its various meanings have been characterised rigorously enough.  All of the theorists mentioned above except Fodor characterise notions of modularity by stipulating one or more properties their kind of module is supposed to have.  This way of explicating notions of modularity fails to support principled ways of resolving controversy.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">No key explanatory notion can be adequately characterised by listing properties because the explanatory power of any notion depends in part on there being something which unifies its properties and merely listing properties says nothing about why they cluster together.</div>
  <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div class="notes">Interestingly, Fodor doesn't define modules by specifying a cluster of properties (pace Sperber 2001: 51); he mentions the properties only as a way of gesturing towards the phenomenon (Fodor 1983: 37) and he also says that modules constitute a natural kind (see Fodor 1983: 101 quoted above). </div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_031.jpg" class="bkg"/>

  <div class="notes">It is tempting to appeal to spatial metaphors in thinking about modularity.  Just as academics tend to work at high-speed on domain-specific problems when they can cut themselves off from administrative centres, so we might attempt to explain the special properties of modules by saying that they are cut off from the central system.  But it isn't clear how to turn this metaphor into an explanation.  The spatial metaphor only gives us the illusion that we understand modularity.</div><img src="/img/slide_emergence_warwick_032.jpg" class="bkg"/>
