  <div class="notes">To sum up so far, the question for this course is, How do humans come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?</div>
  <div class="notes">I've been suggesting we can't answer it simply by appealing to nativism, empiricism or other grand myths.</div>
  <div class="notes">Instead we need to focus on the particular mechanisms that are involved in different cases.</div>
  <div class="notes">But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly pscyhological---and therefore scientific---issue?</div>

  <div class="notes">I hope I've given you a flavour of the approach we're going to take.</div>
  <div class="notes">Good philosophy of mind has always been driven by scientific findings about the mind.</div>
  <div class="notes">John Locke, David Hume as well as more recent philosophers like Jerry Fodor and Andy Clark all start with a deep understanding of the science of the mind.</div>
  <div class="notes">But there is a difference.</div>
  <div class="notes">Locke, Fodor and the rest are working on the big picture, trying to make explicit general features of the conceptual framework which scientists have more or less implicitly adopted.</div>
  <div class="notes">By contrast, what I want us to do in this course is to look at specific problems that arise from the evidence,</div>
  <div class="notes">and to provide philosophical tools for tackling this problem.</div>
  <div class="notes">So you might say that whereas John Locke was trying to be the architect, we're trying more modestly to build the tools.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now this might sound too modest to be interesting.</div>
  <div class="notes">But, as we'll see, it turns out that attention to the details will give us new perspectives on some key philosophical issues about the nature of knowledge, perception and action.</div>

Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally your predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs.  A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in many---but not in all---instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.’</div>

        </div>
        <div class="slide">
          <div class="notes">The second component is a claim about what it is to have a belief.</div>
          <p>(b) The metaphysics</p>
          <p>‘any object [...] whose behavior is well predicted by this strategy is in the fullest sense of the word a believer.  <span class="slide nodim">What it is to be a true believer is to be [...] a system whose behavior is <span class="highlight1">reliably and voluminously predictable</span><span> via the intentional strategy.’</span></span></p>

          <div class="handout">(b) \textit{The metaphysics} ‘any object---or as I shall say, any system---whose behavior is well predicted by this strategy is in the fullest sense of the word a believer.  What it is to be a true believer is to be an intentional system, a system whose behavior is reliably and voluminously predictable via the intentional strategy.’</div>
          <div class="handout ctd">\citep[p.\ 15]{Dennett:1987sf}</div>
          <div class="notes">Now Dennett points out that his strategy works well for clams and thermostats.</div>
          <div class="notes">But what about the infants?</div>
          <div class="notes">If we consider just their pattern of looking times, it seems that the strategy does apply.</div>
          <div class="notes">But if we consider their reaching behaviour, it seems that the strategy does not apply.</div>
          <div class="notes">I think this reveals a deep problem for the strategy.</div>
          <div class="notes">As with the simple theory of the mind, the Intentional Stance rests on the background assumption that individuals either have a particular beilef or else they do not have it.</div>
          <div class="notes">But real minds are not so simple.</div>
          <div class="notes">&nbsp;</div>
          <div class="notes">Just here I want to mention a caveat.</div>
          <div class="notes">This is not supposed to be a deep objection to Dennett's metaphysical claim about belief.</div>
          <div class="notes">Perhaps Dennett can refine the strategy he postulates to accommodate the infants.</div>
          <div class="notes">The only point I'm making is that the strategy is too simple.</div>

          <div class="notes">You might object that this is unfair to Dennett and that the Intentional Stance provides a clear verdict on infants because they are not ‘reliably and voluminously predictable’.</div>
          <div class="notes">But since he himself thinks the view applies to clams and theromstats, their simple behaviours must be sufficient for them to be ‘reliably and voluminously predictable’.</div>

  <div class="notes">To flesh this out, I want to introduce the idea that cognitive development is rediscovery.</div>
  <div class="notes">(But not exactly as Plato's myth had it.)</div>
  <div class="notes">There are a series of ways in which knowledge or its prototypes are manifested.</div>
  <div class="words">
    <div class="container_12">
      <div class="grid_12">
        <p>discrimination of Xs from non-Xs</p>
        <p class="right">(objects, colours, actions, numbers, ...)</p>
        <p class="em-above">purposive engagement with Xs</p>
        <p class="em-above">talk about Xs</p>
        <p class="em-above">thought about Xs as such</p>
        <div class="notes">We can ask how humans get from one manifestation to the next.</div>
        <div class="notes">I want to suggest that it involves a process of rediscovery.</div>
        <div class="notes">I don't think it's a case of partial knowledge becoming gradually more complete.</div>
        <div class="notes">Rather, I think the representations at earlier stages shape <span>subject's body, behaviour and attention in ways that facilitate discovery at the next stage. </span></div>
        <div class="notes">And, most importantly, they enable increasingly right forms of social interaction.</div>
        <div class="notes">It is these social interactions---together with the bodily, behavioural and mental changes---that <span>enable subsequent re-discoveries. </span></div>
        <div class="notes">So, on this view, the role of some early-developing abilities in explaining the later acquisition <span>of conceptual understanding does not involve direct representational connections; </span><span>rather the early developing abilities facilitate or enable social interaction <span>and influence attention and inform behaviour, </span></span><span>and these influences facilitate development.  </span></div>

<section class="slide">
  <div class="notes">To make this vague idea slightly more concrete, let me zoom in. </div>
  <div class="notes">I think having verbal labels for things sometimes helps with acquiring concepts of them.</div>
  <div class="notes">Now this sounds paradoxical. <span>Doesn't having a label for something mean being able to label correctly? </span><span>And how could you label correctly without the corresponding concept? </span></div>
  <div class="notes">My suggestion is that having core knowledge is not having a concept (many disagree); </div>
  <div class="notes">but core knowledge could underpin your correct use of a label. </div>
  <div class="notes">Now labels are acquired through social interaction, or so I suggested earlier. </div>
  <div class="notes">Hence the picture. </div>
  <div class="words">
    <div class="container_12">
      <div class="grid_12">
        <div class="middle">
          <p class="center"><img src="/img/fig_rediscovery.png"/></p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="notes">Now this picture needs two qualifications. <span>First, it's missing some details, and these details will vary from case to case (what's true of knowledge of objects might not be true of knowledge of number). </span><span>Second, the picture might be completely wrong. </span></div>
  <div class="notes">But even if the picture is wrong, I'll bet that social interaction and core knowledge are both essential for explaining how humans come to know things. </div>
  <div class="notes">So I don't claim to know how these two are necessary, only that they are. </div>
  <div class="notes">In fact my aim isn't primarily to explain to you how these two factors explain the origins of mind. </div>
  <div class="notes">Instead my hope is this. </div>
  <div class="notes">I'll give you the background on social interaction and core knowledge. </div>
  <div class="notes">And you'll tell me how these two (or perhaps other factors) are involved in explaining how humans come to know things about objects, colours, actions, numbers and the rest.</div>
