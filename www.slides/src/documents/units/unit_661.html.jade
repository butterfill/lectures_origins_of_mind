  .notes Infants point to intiate joint engagement Liszkowski et al 2006.
  p Why do infants point?
  p.em-above Liszkowski’s idea: find out by seeing what satisfies them.
  p.em-above hypotheses:
  ol
    li
      span for themselves
      p (prediction: ignoring them makes no difference)
    li
      span to draw attention to themselves
      p (prediction: looking at them is sufficient to satisfy them)
    li
      span to direct attention only
      p (prediction: looking at the referent is sufficient)
    li
      span to initiate joint engagement
      p (prediction: looking at them and the reference is sufficient)
  .notes ‘Four hypotheses about what infants want when they point were tested. First, on the hypothesis that infants pointed for themselves (see above), E neither attended to the infant nor to the event (Ignore condition). 
    | Second, on Moore and D’Entremont’s (2001) hypothesis that infants do not want to direct attention and just want to obtain attention to themselves, E never looked at the event and instead attended to the infant’s face and emoted positively to it (Face condition). 
    | Third, on the hypothesis that infants just wanted to direct attention and nothing else, E only attended to the events (Event condition).
    | Fourth, on our hypothesis that infants want to share attention and interest, E responded to an infant’s point by alternating gaze between the event and the infant, emoting positively about it (Joint Attention condition).’ \citep{Liszkowski:2007mm}
  .notes ‘When interacting with an adult who always reacted consistently in one of four ways, 12-month-olds pointed most often across trials if the adult actively shared her attention and interest in the event (Joint Attention condition)’ \citep[p.\ 305]{liszkowski:2004_twelve}
  .notes ‘Analyses of infants’ points within each event revealed a complementary set of results. In the conditions not involving joint attention, infants repeated their point more often. This repeating behavior presumably indic- ates that they were dissatisfied with the adult’s response, and so they were persisting in their pointing behavior hoping eventually to obtain the desired response (which was presumably joint attention, since children did not repeat themselves very often in this condition).’ \citep{Liszkowski:2007mm}

  .notes Now imagine an experiment with four conditions.
  .notes In each condition, there are several trials involving something appearing and, hopefully, the infant pointing at it.
  .notes So how do the conditions differ?
  +row-bkg('li:eq(0) p')
  .notes In one condition, the experimenter ignores the infant when she points.
  +row-bkg-remove_('li:eq(0) p')
  +row-bkg('li:eq(1) p')
  .notes In another condition, the experimenter looks at the infant only.
  +row-bkg-remove_('li:eq(1) p')
  +row-bkg('li:eq(2) p')
  +row-bkg-remove_('li:eq(2) p')
  +row-bkg('li:eq(3) p')
  +row-bkg-remove('li:eq(3) p')
  .notes What predictions should we make?
  +unblur('li:eq(1) span')
  .notes If infants point to draw attention to themselves, what can we predict?
  +row-bkg('li:eq(1) p, li:eq(3) p', 'pink')
  .notes They should be more satisfied in these conditions.
  +row-bkg('li:eq(0) p, li:eq(2) p', 'teal')
  .notes They should be less satisfied in these conditions.
  .notes But how can we measure satisfaction?
  .notes Within a trial: less satisfied with response should lead to more pointing.
  .notes Across all trials: more satisfied with responses should make it more likely that pointing will occur in a trial (at least once).
  +row-bkg-remove_('li:eq(1) p, li:eq(3) p', 'pink')
  +row-bkg-remove_('li:eq(0) p, li:eq(2) p', 'teal')

  +unblur('li:eq(3) span')
  .notes If infants point to initiate joint engagement, what should we expect then?

  p.center.slide (And to inform.)
  .notes Why is this significant?
  .notes Because it implies two things:
  .notes First, it implies that infants' pointing is referential communication; that is, communication about an object.
  .notes (Contrast sharing a smile; we're communicating, but not necessarily referring.)
  .notes Second, it implies that infants have some understanding of joint engagement.
  .notes I'll come back to this in later.

+slide
  .notes By the way, this is related to the essay topic on shared intentionality.
  .notes Tomasello takes infants' pointing to be based on what he calls shared intentionality.
  p shared intentionality
  p.em-above.handout.show ‘infant pointing is best understood---on many levels and in many ways---as depending on uniquely human skills and motivations for cooperation and shared intentionality, which enable such things as joint intentions and joint attention in truly collaborative interactions with others (Bratman, 1992; Searle, 1995).’

  .handout.ctd \citep[p.\ 706]{Tomasello:2007fi}
  .notes I don't want to pursue this here; I'm just mentioning it because you might want to draw on pointing in your seminar essays.
  .notes Instead I want to ask in a simpler way, how should we understand pointing as other non-linguistic forms of communication?
  .notes To approach this question, it's helpful to compare and contrast humans with other, nonhuman apes.

  .notes In this experiment, we contrast failed reaches with pointing ...
  .notes Hare and Call (\citeyear{hare_chimpanzees_2004}) contrast pointing with a failed reach as two ways of indicating which of two closed containers a reward is in.  Chimps can easily interpret a failed reach but are stumped by the point to a closed container.
  .notes You are the subjects.  This is what you saw (two conditions).  Your task was to choose the container with the reward.
  .notes Infants can do this sort of task, it's really easy for them \citep{Behne:2005qh}.  (And, incidentally, they distinguish communicative points from similar but non-communicative bodily configurations.)
  .notes The pictures in the figure stand for what participants, who were chimpanzees, saw.
  .notes The question was whether participants would be able to work out which of two containers concealed a reward.
  .notes In the condition depicted in the left panel, participants saw a chimpanzee trying but failing to reach for the correct container. 
  .notes Participants had no problem getting the reward in this case, suggesting that they understood the goal of the failed reach.
  .notes In the condition depicted in the right panel, a human pointed at the correct container.
  .notes Participants did not get the reward in this case as often as in the failed reach case, suggesting that they failed to understand the goal of the pointing action.
  .notes (Actually the apes were above chance in using the point, just better in the failed reach condition.  Hare et al comment ;chimpanzees can learn to exploit a pointing cue with some experience, as established by previous research (Povinelli et al. 1997; Call et al. 1998, 2000), and so by the time they engaged in this condition they had learned to use arm extension as a discriminative cue to the food’s location' \citep[p.\ 578]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}.)
  .notes \footnote{
    | The contrast between the two conditions is not due merely to the fact that one involves a human and the other a chimpanzee. 
    | Participants were also successful when the failed reach was executed by a human rather than another chimpanzee \citep[][experiment 1]{hare_chimpanzees_2004}. 
    | }
  .notes \textbf{Note that} chimpanzees do follow the point to a container \citep[see][p.\ 6]{Moll:2007gu}.

  p.center Why don't 3-month-olds point?
  .notes Tomasello also asks this question.
  .notes.handout 'the specific behavioral form---distinctive hand shape with extended index finger---actually emerges reliably in infants as young as 3 months of age (Hannan \& Fogel, 1987). [...] why do infants not learn to use the extended index finger for these social functions at 3 – 6 months of age, but only at 12 months of age?' \citep[p.\ 716]{Tomasello:2007fi}
  .notes Again his answer involves shared intentionality: it's because they don't understand shared intentionality until around their first birthdays.

  // .notes \citet[p.\ 492]{Behne:2005qh}: 'the infant asks herself: Why did the adult do this for me? Why is this object to which he is gesturing relevant to our interaction?'
  .notes I want to say a tiny bit more on what is involved in understanding a pointing gesture.
  .notes Suppose that we are doing puzzle.  Then if I point to a piece, I probably intend you to do something with it in the context of our activity.
  .notes By contrast, if we are tidying up, a point to the same object might mean something different.
  .notes So: 
  .notes.handout Comprehending pointing is not just a matter of locking onto the thing pointed to; it also involves some sensitivity to context \citep[see][]{Liebal:2010lr}.
  .notes This is nicely brought out in a study by Christina Liebel and others.

  .handout ‘the most fundamental aspects of language that make it such a uniquely powerful form of human cognition and communication---joint attention, reference via perspectives, reference to absent entities, cooperative motives to help and to share, and other embodiments of shared intentionality---are already present in the humble act of infant pointing.’ \citep[p.\ 719]{Tomasello:2007fi}
