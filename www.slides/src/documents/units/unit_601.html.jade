  .notes In the last lecture, we considered communication with language.
  .notes My overall plan now is to work backwards to consider communication generally, and then back again to action understanding.
  .notes I suggested that acquiring an ability to commmunicate with language typically involves (a) social interaction and (b) creating words.
  .notes I think looking at communication generally will help bring this into clearer focus.
  .notes But before I get into this, I want to take a huge detour.
  .notes The huge detour will allow me (i) to connect up the different things we've done; and (ii) pick up on some themes from your assessed essays.
  .notes (The detour means that this lecture, unlike the others, doesn't have a single overall theme.)

  .notes I wanted to try to start drawing things together before the end of the last lecture.
  .notes This will mean a bit of repetition, but it will also help us in thinking through the issues together.

  .notes This isn't a new question, but I think it's worth spending more time on it as a way of organising much of what we've been learning.

  .notes There are two approaches.
  .notes One involves finding out what people who use the term say it is.

  .notes So talk of core knowledge is somehow supposed to latch onto the idea of a system.
  .notes What do these authors mean by talking about 'specialized perceptual systems'?
  .notes They talk about things like perceiving colour, depth or melodies.
  .notes Now, as we saw when talking about categorical perception of colour, we can think of the 'system' underlying categorical perception as largely separate from other cognitive systems--- we saw that they could be knocked out by verbal interference, for example.
  .notes So the idea is that core knowledge somehow involves a system that is separable from other cognitive mechanisms.
  .notes As Carey rather grandly puts it, understanding core knowledge will involve understanding something about 'the architecture of the mind'.

  .notes This is helpful for getting started.
  .notes But we quickly run into the problem that different researchers say different things, and it isn't obvious which differences matter.
  .notes We also run into the problem that the definitions on offer aren't obviously correct: they list features that maybe aren't all necessary.

  .notes I said there were two approaches to answering the question, What is core knowledge?
  .notes The second approach is inspired by the notion of radical interpretation.
  p.notes.show ‘All understanding of the speech of another involves radical interpretation’
  p.right Davidson 1973, p. 125
  .notes.ctd \citep[p.\ 125]{Davidson:1973jx}
  .notes (It's not just core knowledge; I think we have too approach science as radical interpreters ...)
  .notes How does radical interpretation work?
  .notes Interpretation is hard because there are two factors: truth and meaning.
  .notes The proposal Davidson makes is that we assume truth and infer meaning.
  .notes I'm recommending a similar strategy for core knowledge.
  .notes Very roughly, we take for granted that the evidence establishes various hypotheses.  We then ask what core knowledge could be given these are true.
  .notes But more carefully, we first have to ask what motivates talk about core knowledge at all.

  .notes So why do we need the notion of core knowledge?
  .notes Think about these domains.
  .notes In each case, we're push towards postulating that infants know things, but also pushed against this.
  .notes Resolving the apparent contradiction is what core knowledge is for.
  +discrepancy_table
  .notes Key question: What features do we have to assign to core knowledge if it's to describe these discrepancies?
  .notes I think the fundamental feature is inaccessibility.

+slide_middle
  .notes To say that a system or module exhibits limited accessibility is to say that the representations in the system are not usually inferentially integrated with knowledge.
  .notes I think this is the key feature we need to assign to core knowledge in order to explain the apparent discrepancies in the findings about when knowledge emerges in development.
  p.center limited accessibility to knowledge

section.slide
  .notes Limited accessbility is a familar feature of many cognitive systems.
  .notes When you grasp an object with a precision grip, it turns out that there is a very reliable pattern.
  .notes At a certain point in moving towards it your fingers will reach a maximum grip aperture which is normally a certain amount wider than the object to be grasped, and then start to close.
  .notes Now there's no physiological reason why grasping should work like this, rather than grip hand closing only once you contact the object.
  .notes Maximum grip aperture shows anticipation of the object: the mechanism responsible for guiding your action does so by representing various things including some features of the object.
  .notes But we ordinarily have no idea about this.
  .notes The discovery of how grasping is controlled depended on high speed photography.
  .notes This is an illustration of limited accessibility.
  .notes (This can also illustrate information encapsulation and domain specificity.)

  .notes This picture is significantly different from some competitors (but not Carey on number):
  .notes (1) because it shows we aren't done when we've explained the acquisition of core knowledge (contra e.g. Leslie, Baillargeon), and
  .notes (2) because it shows we can't hope to explain the acquisition of knowledge if we ignore core knowledge (contra e.g. Tomasello)



+slide
  .notes ***todo*** say something about what we've learnt from each case.
  .notes Or maybe identify themes and point out which cases they're 
  .notes e.g. colour shows (i) that perceptual mechanisms are important and (ii) that infants' core knowledge persists into adulthood
  +discrepancy_table({step:false})


+slide_middle
  .notes Let me pause to evalaute the picture I offered in lecture 1 in the light of what we've learnt so far.
  .notes (I hesitate to do this because it shows the picture I offered you isn't very good.)
  .notes Take each case in turn.
  .notes For colour it works quite well, providing, as I suggested last week, that acquiring words is a creative process of social interaction.
  .notes What about physical objects?  Here there's no indication that using labels for objects drives a developmental change, and it's hard to see why it would.
  .notes (It's more plausible that tool use rather than word use matters; but even this is is hugely speculative.)
  .notes So no marks for that case at all.
  .notes What about minds, and in particular beliefs?
  .notes Superficially things look better here.  There is both evidence that rich forms of social interaction facilitate development \citep{Hughes:2006fu}
  .notes and also evidence that language matters in various ways \citep{Astington2005ot}.
  .notes But these probably don't connect in the simple way I envisage.
  .notes Social interaction might matter because it provides experiences of perspective differences, or because it motivates children to think about others' minds.
  .notes And language might matter because having sentences around enables them to keep track of beliefs, or because using relative clauses might clue them in to a relation between beliefs and what utterances of sentences express.
  .notes So here the picture isn't right, but it might not be a million miles off either ...
  .notes It's wrong to think that labelling beliefs matters; but it may be that being able to talk about beliefs (implicitly or otherwise) does matter for coming to have knowledge of them.
