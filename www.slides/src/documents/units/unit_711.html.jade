Is it a model on which actions are related to goals by intentions?  Or could they be using another, perhaps simpler model of the relation between actions and the goals to which they are directed?"

  .notes In this section we ask, What do infants understand of actions and their goals?
  .notes Or, as I like to put the quesiton, What model of action underpins infant cognition of action?
  p.center What do six- or twelve-month-old infants understand of actions and their goals?

  .notes What is the relation between an action and the outcome or outcomes to which it is directed?
  .notes One feature of actions is that they are directed to goals.
  .notes I seize little Isabel by the wrists and swing her around, thereby  making her laugh and breaking a vase.
  .notes You might wonder what the goal of my action was.
  .notes Did I act in order to break the  vase or to make Isabel laugh?
  .notes Or was my action perhaps directed to some other goal, one that was not realised so that my action failed?
  .notes 
  .notes A basic challenge for an account of action is to explain the relation between actions and the goal or goals to which they are directed.
  .notes Among all of the actual and possible outcomes of an action, which are goals of the action?
  .notes 
  .notes The standard answer to this question involves intention.
  .notes An intention (1) represents an outcome, (2) causes an event; and (3) causes an event whose occurrence would normally lead to the outcomeâ€™s occurrence.
  .notes What singles out an actual or possible outcome as one to which the component actions are collectively directed?  It is the fact that this outcome is represented by the intention.
  .notes 
  .notes So the intention is what links an action to the outcomes to which it is directed.

  .notes Now we have to ask, What is an intention?
  .notes First note that goals are not intentions.
  .notes Goals are actual or possible outcomes.
  .notes They are states of affairs.
  .notes Intentions, by contrast, are or involve mental states that represent a goal.
  .notes It would be a terrible mistake to confuse a goal with a goal-state.
  .notes That would be like confusing a person with a photograph.

//- pure goal ascription

  .notes How could pure goal ascription work?
  .notes Could you maybe think about the goal and not the intention and that would be enough?
  .notes Well no because a goal is just an outcome.  Let me try to explain with an example ...

  p *** explain the idea: mindreading is acting in reverse
  p *** so, why not think of goal ascription as part of acting in reverse too?

  p ***remaining questions

+slide
  p Todo:
  p Describe what we've done for goals (specify R(a,G)); challenge them to do the same for reference (i.e. to provide a model of R(utterance,object))
  p (This links to our unfinished business finding an alterantive to the Gricean view.)
  p.em-above Stress that if infants aren't representing intentions then:
  ol
    li Grice on meaning is not the thing to appeal to to understand early communication
    li Shared intentionality can't be understood in terms of nested intentions
    li ... and this matters for joint action
