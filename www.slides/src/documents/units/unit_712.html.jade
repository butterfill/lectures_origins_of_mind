  .notes How could pure goal ascription work?
  .notes Could you maybe think about the goal and not the intention and that would be enough?
  .notes Well no because a goal is just an outcome.  Let me try to explain with an example ...

each img_no in img_nos
  - var filename = 'slide_budapest_lecture06_0'+(img_no<10 ? '0' : '')+img_no+'.jpg'

  p *** explain the idea: mindreading is acting in reverse
  p *** so, why not think of goal ascription as part of acting in reverse too?

  p ***remaining questions

  p Todo:
  p Describe what we've done for goals (specify R(a,G)); challenge them to do the same for reference (i.e. to provide a model of R(utterance,object))
  p (This links to our unfinished business finding an alterantive to the Gricean view.)
  p.em-above Stress that if infants aren't representing intentions then:
  ol
    li Grice on meaning is not the thing to appeal to to understand early communication
    li Shared intentionality can't be understood in terms of nested intentions
    li ... and this matters for joint action
