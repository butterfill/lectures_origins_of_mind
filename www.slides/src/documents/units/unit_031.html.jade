    .notes The question is how humans come to know about objects, words, thoughts and other things.
    .notes In pursuing this question we have to consider minds where the knowledge is neither clearly present nor obviously absent. 
    .notes This is challenging because both commonsense and theoretical tools for describing minds are generally designed for characterising fully developed adults.

    .notes So the problem is that we seem to have conflicting answers to the question: one set of evidence says early, the other late.
    .notes Resolving the apparent conflict requires responding to an instance of Davidson's challenge and finding ways of describing phenomena in between mindless ignorance of unseen objects and adult-like knowledge of objects.  
    .notes In what follows we will repeatedly encounter challenges of this form.
    mixin words-bkg('.highlight1','pink')
    .notes At this point you might object.  The question is about knowledge.  But does either searching or distinguishing really provide evidence of knowing?

      p.em-above talk about objects: much later
      .notes You might insist that only abilities to talk about objects manifest evidence of knowledge.
      .notes It is a good question whether searching or distinguishing manifests knowledge.
      .notes We'll return to this point later.
    mixin unremove('.step4')
    .notes First note that we can duck this hard issue by changing from talk about knowledge to talk about representation.
    .notes Searching and distinguishing certainly seem to show that infants are representing objects they can't see.
    .notes Second note that whether or not the things manifested in searching and distinguishing are knowledge proper, they are surely things that matter for explaining how knowledge is eventually acquired.

    .notes The paradox of early permanence provides us with a challenge of exactly this sort.
    .notes At least some of infants' abilities to represent objects they can't see don't involve knowledge or thought proper, but are neither entirely mindless.  They do involve representation of some kind.

  .notes Hood and colleagues make a related point.

      .notes We should be cautious about the inferenc from separable systems to kinds of knowledge.  (Think about modularity.)


section.slide
  .notes To sum up so far, the question for this course is, How do humans come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?
  .notes I've been suggesting we can't answer it simply by appealing to nativism, empiricism or other grand myths.
  .notes Instead we need to focus on the particular mechanisms that are involved in different cases.
  .notes But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly pscyhological---and therefore scientific---issue?
  .notes The answer is no because thinking about how humans come to know things requires us to meet Davidson's challenge, to understand things that are neither mindless nor thought or knowledge but somewhere in between.
  .notes As Hood suggests in the quote I just showed you, this might involve rethinking what knowledge is.

      li For each possible thought content and thinker, the thinker either has or hasn't a representation with that content.
      li Thinkers' actions are causally explained by their representations.
    .notes What the findings about infants' representations of objects they can't see show is this:
    .notes we must reject the simple theory of the mind.

section.slide
  .notes So we must reject the simple theory.
  .notes Of course this doesn't follow just from the data I've mentioned so far.
  .notes But in these lectures we'll see the same sort of contradiction coming up in different domains, not just knowledge of objects but also number, colour, agency and others.
  .notes Now it's easy to say that the simple theory of the mind must be rejected.

    p ‘when five-month-old infants observe first a single object that is occluded by a moving screen and then a second object that joins the first behind  he screen, they subsequently look longer when the screen is lowered to reveal one object (an unexpected outcome to adults, but one that is superficially familiar since only one object ever was visible in the scene at any given time) than when it is lowered to reveal two objects (Wynn, 1992)’
    p ‘when 2.5 month-old infants observe an object hidden either inside or behind a container and then see the object again when the container is moved to the side, they react differently depending on how the object is hidden (Hespos and Baillargeon, 2001a).’

    p *todo* add example of \citep{wang:2004_young}
    p  ‘In two experiments, 4-month-old infants were tested in VOE tasks with test trials only. The infants still gave evidence that they could represent and reason about hidden objects: they were surprised, as indicated by greater attention, when a wide object became fully hidden behind a narrow occluder (Experiment 1) or inside a narrow container (Experiment 2). These and control results demonstrate that young infants can succeed at VOE tasks involving hidden objects even when given no habituation or familiarization trials.’
