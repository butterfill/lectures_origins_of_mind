    <div class="notes">To sum up so far, the question for this course is, How do humans come to know  about---and to knowingly manipulate---objects, causes, words, numbers, colours, actions and minds?</div>
    <div class="notes">I've been suggesting we can't answer it simply by appealing to nativism, empiricism or other grand myths.</div>
    <div class="notes">Instead we need to focus on the particular mechanisms that are involved in different cases.</div>
    <div class="notes">But then you might wonder, What philosophical questions arise here?  Isn't this a narrowly pscyhological---and therefore scientific---issue?</div>
    <div class="notes">The answer is no because thinking about how humans come to know things requires us to meet Davidson's challenge, to understand things that are neither mindless nor thought or knowledge but somewhere in between.</div>
    <div class="notes">As Hood suggests in the quote I just showed you, this might involve rethinking what knowledge is.</div>
