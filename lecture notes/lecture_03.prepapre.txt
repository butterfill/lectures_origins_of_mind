This lecture is about objects and their interactions.

background :  scholl (2010) = object persistence.  Confirms the importance of three principles; also of object files and uses object-specific preview effect

background : nb distinguish (i) segment from (ii) represent objects as persisting; and (iii) causal interactions among objects


1. Infants' representations of unperceived objects
==================================
	- features vs objects (segment: no fact of the matter about how many when two overlap; (ii) persist: spotlight isn't anywhere while turned off; doesn't have a counterfactual history; (iii) no causal interactions).
	- another couple of studies
	- picking out objects
	- Spelke principles*
	- stress that we're talking about inference here**
	- comparison to Chomsky on knowledge of syntax [or do this in §1.5]

* Spelke’s position might be put like this:
i.	We (as perceivers) start with a cross-modal representation of three-dimensional perceptual features which includes their locations and trajectories.
ii.	Our task is to get from these representations of features to representations of objects.
iii.	Descriptive component  We do this in accordance with certain principles (cohesion, boundedness, rigidity, and no action at a distance).
iv.	Explanatory component  We acquire representations of objects because we apply the principles to representations of features and draw appropriate inferences.
The key point for our purposes is the explanatory component.  The principles are not supposed to be merely heuristics for describing and predicting infants’ performance on preferential looking tasks.  Rather, these principles are supposed to explain why infants look longer at some things than at others.  This what motivates the hypothesis that infants know these principles and use them in reasoning about objects: unless this hypothesis is true, it’s hard to understand how the principles could have explanatory relevance.   


** [1 of 2]:
“To make sense of such results [i.e. the results from violation-of-expectation tasks], we ... must assume that infants, like older learners, formulate rules or hypotheses about physical events and revise and elaborate these hypotheses in light of additional input.” (Aguiar and Baillargeon 2002: 329).

** [2 of 2]:
“The infants looked reliably longer at the narrow- than at the wide-occluder event [i.e. at the discrepant event], suggesting that they (a) believed that the object continued to exist when lowered behind the occluder; (b) realized that the width of the object relative to that of the occluder determined whether the object could be fully or only partly hidden when behind the occluder; and (c) expected the object to be fully hidden when lowered behind the wide but not the narrow occluder, and were surprised or puzzled when this last expectation was violated” (Baillargeon 2000: 452).



1.5 The simple view 
==================================
	- the simple view is that the Spelke principles are just known in whatever sense anything is known
	- compare Fodor on Chomsky*
	- on the simple view, the answer to our questions is that there is no transition because there is no stage of not knowing about objects

*“Chomsky’s nativism is primarily a thesis about knowledge and belief; it aligns problems in the theory of language with those in the theory of knowledge.  Indeed, as often as not, the vocabulary in which Chomsky frames linguistic issues is explicitly epistemological.  Thus, the grammar of a language specifies what its speaker/hearers have to know qua speakers and hearers; and the goal of the child’s language acquisition process is to construct a theory of the language that correctly expresses this grammatical knowledge.  Likewise, the central problem of language acquisition arises from the poverty of the “primary linguistic data” from which the child effects this construction; and the proposed solution of the problem is that much of the knowledge that linguistic competence depends on is available to the child a priori (i.e., prior to learning).  Everything I’ve put in italics belongs to the epistemologist’s vocabulary” (Fodor 2000: 11)
	
	- the simple view isn't exactly Spelke's (or Chomsky's), but it's a useful starting point for discussion. 
	
	[*where do the following points go?]
	- at the same time, Chomsky wants to say that —“knowledge”, “theory” and the like—are not supposed to be identical with their commonsense psychological counterparts Compare Chomsky (2000: 99): “Those who speak of “the fact that linguistic meaning involves deliberate rule-following” are using the term “rule-following” in a technical sense of philosophical discourse, not in the conventional way ….  I think the same is true of other terms of philosophical discourse, including “knowledge,” “content,” and “reference,” among others.”
	- This is unsatisfactory if we don't know what the technical sense is.
	- Spelke herself wants to talk about talk about core knowledge.  Her characterisation is also unsatisfactory for the same reason that characterisations of modularity are unsatisfactory: list of properties.  (Quote opposition from discussion with Chris Frith).
	


2. Infants' representations of causal interactions
==================================
	- early Spelke habituation (\citep{spelke_1992:origins})
	- more recent
	- [nothing on perception, nothing on reaching]
	- Spelke's insight that the same principles might explain (i) object individuation, (ii) causal interaction
	- nativism about knowledge (the principles), not just concepts



2.5 Nonhuman animals
==================================
	- object tracking found in nohumans*
	- adult humans' visual system is limited like adults**
	- [later] *adult* rhesus monkeys also fail to search but pass v-of-e tasks*** also marmosets**** (this is important because it indicates that the failures to search are a feature of the core knowledge system rather than a deficit in human infants)

*See Santos & Hood 2009, p. 7: 'If the CK hypothesis is correct, one might expect that humans share their innately specified object representation mechanisms with other animals, particularly other closely related primates.'  They go on to review; more detailed review in Santos 2004.

**See Santos & Hood 2009 p. 12: 'the visual system is limited in the same way as infants’ object individuation capacities: it is bound to spatiotemporally distinct objects, and appears to ignore other featural information (e.g., Kahneman & Treisman, 1984; Kahneman et al., 1992; Scholl, 2001; Scholl & Pylyshyn, 1999; Yantis, 1995; see Cheries et al., Chapter 5, for review). In addition, similar to infants, adults appear to show deficits on visual track- ing tasks in which objects do not cohere across time and space (van Marle & Scholl, 2003, see also Mitroff, Scholl, & Wynn, 2005).'

***See Santos & Hood 2009 p. 17: 'Hauser, Santos and colleagues have demonstrated that a number of different nonhuman primates perform poorly on search tasks involving object motion even as adults. For example, adult rhesus monkeys search incorrectly for objects that are dropped onto a stage (Hauser, 2001), despite the fact that they look longer at such violations (Santos & Hauser, 2002). ... to date, adult primates’ failures on search tasks appear to exactly mirror the cases in which human toddlers perform poorly (see Santos, 2004, for review).'

§3.0 Reservations about inference and knowledge
==================================
	-	It is perhaps hard to accept that four-month-old infants are in the business of formulating and revising hypotheses.  (Come to think of it, it’s quite hard to accept that adults typically acquire representations of unperceived objects by formulating and revising hypotheses.)  But if infants aren’t doing this, what are they doing that enables them to pass violation-of-expectation tasks?
	- One reason is that we might think of someone who knows as capable of belief vs knowledge, as needing a distinction.  Doesn't seem to fit infants.  
	- Also we might think of inference as something that a detective does.  Not obvious that the same process is occurring in infants.
	- But, again, if it isn't the same process, then what is it?


§3.1 A puzzle for the simple view
==================================
	- You already know about failure to reach
	- Also failure to reach in the mechanical cases (Hood &c; \citep{keen:2008_toddlers})
	- Why is this a puzzle for the simple view?  Because knowledge is defined in part in terms of its consequences for action.  The simple view predicts no difference between reaching and other methods.
	- How to resolve the problem?
	- problems with performing actions (coordination, means-end reasoning) : the claim these these problems was already eliminated in seminars, plus hardly needs saying at 2.5 years!
	- strength of representation : subject - attitude - content - new variable needs to be explained in a principled way (what do we mean by strength?)
	- kind of representation.  How to develop this idea?
		- need to specify (a) processes; (b) format; (c) functional role? ???
		- the specification needs to (i) fit what we know about the limits of core knowledge; (ii) make testable predictions about new limits


* link to (I) perceptual expectations, and (ii) to adults : the michotte et al triangle illusion (showing judgement-independence in adults)
* further supported by:
\citep{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus} on representational momentum**
--- adults, including trained physicists who make correct verbal predictions about the effects of mass on motion, show representational momentum (a perceptual effect) consistent with impetus and inconsistent with Newtonian mechanics.  So again we have (i) judgement-independence and (ii) adults.  ('both physics experts and novices possess the same set of implicit beliefs about motion.' \citep[p.\ 451]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus})
--- limits of infants' systems found in adults shows that we can identify the system as persisting 
--- What questions does this bear on?  (1) perceptual & modular nature of infants' understanding of objects and their interactions; (2) relation between infant competence and adults' (do the thing about system being transformed or discarded versus two systems persisting through development : this is different from issues about innateness, which looks from infants' competence backwards --- here we go in the other direction, looking forwards); and (3) trade-offs between flexibility and efficiency (see below; worth talking about this in some detail here)
--- Kozhevnikov & Hegarty discuss ascending motion but you also get RM effects for curved tube exit: 'In Freyd and Jones’ study [(1994)], greater RM was observed for the impetus (spiral) than for the Newtonian (straight) path.'* (p. 449)
--- note that other studies also show judgement-independence, but in the other way (implicit knowledge of physical interactions more accurate than judgement: 'a number of previous studies suggesting a dissociation between explicit and implicit knowledge of the principles of physics. For instance, Hubbard suggests that implicit knowledge reflects internalization of invariant physical principles, whereas explicit knowledge about motion may be less accurate. Similarly, Krist et al. (1993) suggested that perceptually based knowledge is more accurate than verbal concepts of motion.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}
--- on cognitive efficiency:  	'To extrapolate objects’ motion on the basis of physical principles, one should have assessed and evaluated the presence and magnitude of such imperceptible forces as friction and air resistance operating in the real world.  This would require a time-consuming analysis that is not always possible. In order to have a survival advantage, the process of extrapolation should be fast and effortless, without much conscious deliberation. Impetus theory allows us to extrapolate objects’ motion quickly and without large demands on attentional resources.' \citep[p.\ 450]{kozhevnikov:2001_impetus}

* \citep{freyd:1994_representational}  ('The results are also consistent with a claim of relative cognitive impenetrability (Finke & Freyd, 1989; Kelly & Freyd, 1987) in that subjects showed a memory shift for a path that the majority of subjects did not consciously consider correct.' \citep[p.\ 975]{freyd:1994_representational})

**caution (basically fine, but need to be careful): 'The extent to which displacement reflects physical principles per se has been widely debated in the literature; theories of displacement suggest a variety of potential effects of physical principles ranging from an incorporation of the principle of momentum into mental representation (e.g., Finke et al., 1986) to a rejection of any internalization of physical principles (e.g., Kerzel, 2000, 2003a). The empirical evidence is clear that (1) displacement does not always correspond to predictions based on physical principles and (2) variables unrelated to physical principles (e.g., the presence of landmarks, target identity, or expectations regarding a change in target direction) can influence displacement. ... information based on a naive understanding of physical principles or on subjective consequences of physical principles appears to be just one of many types of information that could potentially contribute to the displacement of any given target' \citep[p.\ 842]{hubbard:2005_representational}

+On the link between children and adults:
Discussing the Hood et al, use representational momentum: 'the dynamic representations that often govern adult judgments of spatio-temporal events also govern those of young children.' \citep[p.\ F22]{perry:2008_representational}.  BUT this is less promising than it seems: they are measuring search (which door is opened) rather than looking.


*discuss Scholl & Leslie (1999)?  Santos & Hood put a lot of emphasis on this (in their 2009 intro to book):
	- first when talking about persistence 
	- second, when talking about individuation (Santos & Hood  p. 12: 'These similarities have led to the view that adult attentional mechanisms may underlie infants’ performance on object individuation tasks (Carey & Xu, 2001; Chiang & Wynn, 2000; Leslie et al., 1998; Scholl, 2001; Scholl & Leslie, 1999; Simon, 1997; Wynn & Chiang, 1998).')


[*problem: minimal producer-consumer notion of representation --- don't all the problems go away here?  (Just specify producer and consumer?)]

[*Aim to get to the point where can talk about violation of expectations from the subject's point of view --- the process results in phenomenal signal of error but not an experience of the particular kind of error.]

[*Drawing parallels between core knowledge and categorical perception: does it help at all?]


§4. Kinds of representation
==================================
  - paradigms from perceptual and motor processes (these involve representations that are unlike knowledge and differ in format and with respect to process).
  - modularity?

Core systems are ‘structures … just as specific as those that underlie animal cognition, human perception, and human action.  ‘Just as humans are endowed with multiple, specialized perceptual systems, so we are endowed with multiple systems for representing and reasoning about entities of different kinds.’ 
(Carey and Spelke 1996: 517)

‘core systems are conceptual and provide a foundation for the growth of knowledge.  … core systems are largely innate, encapsulated, and unchanging, arising from phylogenetically old systems built upon the output of innate perceptual analyzers.’ 
(Carey and Spelke 1996: 520)
