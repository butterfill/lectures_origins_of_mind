0. The idea about assembling core knowledge through language
- motivation: in these cases we saw that there's a gap between core knowledge (or something like it) and knowledge proper: (i) colour; (ii) physical objects; (iii) minds
- re-explain what core knowledge is
- theory of core knowledge implies that there should be a gap: core knowledge is domain-specific
- state the assembling idea 
- hard to make systematic sense of the idea about assembling
- maybe rediscovery is a better model --- core knowledge helps you do thinks with words, which helps you understand things
- illustrate the rediscovery idea by syntax: core knowledge of syntax is innate, but if we want to understand the syntax of our language we have to rediscover it.

What, if anything, is the role of language & social interaction in rediscovery?
- saw a potential example in the case of colour (categorical perception/words/knowledge)
- will see an example of it in the case of number
- can also say something about it in the case of mindreading
- this motivates us to continue thinking about language and social interaction

1. Social interaction before language
- simply describe it

2. Pre-linguistic communication
- simply describe it

3. return to the end of Topic 5: I suggested that children's understanding of words is Gricean:
- issue different from the mapping issue (not which concepts map to words, how do they understand that words can be communicative tools at all)
- Gricean account of utterances adapted for words
- Too sophisticated.  Can we appeal to core knowledge instead?
[This will lead to understanding of action.  If its motoric, the answer will be no.]
